Here is a clear and simple difference between List and Tuple in Python:

✅ Difference Between List and Tuple
Feature	List	Tuple
Mutability	Mutable (you can change values)	Immutable (values cannot be changed)
Syntax	[] square brackets	() parentheses
Performance	Slower	Faster than list
Use Case	When you need to modify data	When data should not change
Methods Available	Many (append, remove, sort, etc.)	Very few (count, index)
Memory Usage	Uses more memory	Uses less memory
📌 Example of List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
fruits[1] = "orange"   # Changing allowed
print(fruits)


Output:

['apple', 'orange', 'mango']

📌 Example of Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
colors[1] = "yellow"   # NOT allowed → will give error


Error:

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

⭐ Quick Summary

List = Changeable

Tuple = Unchangeable

List = []

Tuple = ()

List = Slow

Tuple = Fast & safe
